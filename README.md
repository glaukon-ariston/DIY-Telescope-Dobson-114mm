# A DIY Build of a Dobsonian Telescope
This build is inspired by the [Baby Dob 114mm F8](http://scopemaking.net/hrv/babydob.htm) project from [scopemaking.net](http://scopemaking.net/) website. Also, quite useful reference is a comprehensive Stellafane's tutorial on [building a Dobsonian telescope](https://stellafane.org/tm/dob/index.html).

## Mirrors
The primary and secondary mirrors are bought on eBay. The primary is a spherical mirror with 114mm/4.5" diameter and 900mm focal length (F8).

## Mirror Cell
Holds the primary mirror in place.

## Spider
This thing holds the secondary mirror in place just below the focuser. It is made from a section of a beech wood dowel rod 25mm in diameter (24mm would have been better as the minor diagonal of the secondary mirror is around 24mm). The vanes are 9cm long sections of [metal cutting blades](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10-PCS-High-Carbon-Steel-Blue-Color-Hacksaw-Blades-300mm-Length-Metalworking-Blade-for-Cutting-Metal/32636109682.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dNjEELH). The three M4 screws are used in the collimation of the secondary mirror. Needs to be painted in black with matte finish.

## Focuser
The focuser is made out of a [PG-36 cable gland](http://cableglandsdirect.com/pg36.html). The locking nut needs to be worked out with a utility knife in order to widen the opening to 32mm so it can receive a 1.25" eyepiece. The base locking nut which is threaded needs a curve ground in it so it fits the tube snugly. It functions as a (pseudo) helical focuser -- you turn the focuser to change focus.

## Eyepieces
The Super Plossl 26mm eyepiece is made out of 25mm-to-20mm [PP-R pipe fitting](http://www.pprpipefittings.com/), a [film canister](https://www.aliexpress.com/af/film-canister.html?SearchText=film+canister&origin=n&jump=afs) and an [eypiece lens set](https://www.surplusshed.com/pages/item/L1714.html) from Surplus Shed (two achromats and one DCX). The spacers for the lenses are cut from the film canister and fixed with a dab of superglue.

## Finder
The eyepiece and the objective lens are taken from a broken binoculars. The new tube is a PVC electrical conduit. Made to fit using some blue eletrical tape and a little bit of hot gun persuasion.

## Finder Holder
A piece of the main telescope tube as a base, a piece of wood, a 50mm waste water pipe with six M4 screws.

## Tube 

A 160mm diameter waste water tube. Seen here with abrasive papers taped to it for grinding the focuser locking nut. Already painted inside with a black matte finish spray can (after spraying with plastic primer first).

Centering the spider using a centering tool inserted in the focuser and a paper template.

A view through the centering tool. You can see the paper template reflection in the secondary mirror.
